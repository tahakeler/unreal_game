# Test Standards

- Test naming follows the engine's language — every name says the scenario and
  the expected result:
  - **Unreal (Automation):** class `F[System][Scenario]Test` — one per test:
    each `IMPLEMENT_SIMPLE_AUTOMATION_TEST` defines its class, so a second test
    reusing a name fails to link — test name
    `<Project>.[System].[Scenario]` — the project's test command,
    `Automation RunTests <Project>.`, runs every test whose name contains
    `<Project>.` (a substring match, not a prefix). `<Project>.` is the root
    that filter in `commands.test` uses: the project name, or the distinct root
    `/setup-engine` chose when the project's name is also an engine area
    (`Audio`, `Core`, `Input`, …) — name tests under whichever it is
- Every test must have a clear arrange/act/assert structure
- Unit tests must not depend on external state (filesystem, network, database)
- Integration tests must clean up after themselves
- Performance tests must specify acceptable thresholds and fail if exceeded
- Test data must be defined in the test or in dedicated fixtures, never shared mutable state
- Mock external dependencies — tests should be fast and deterministic
- Every bug fix must have a regression test that would have caught the original bug —
  and **you must watch it fail before you trust it.** Run the new test against the
  unfixed code, confirm it fails, then apply the fix and confirm it passes. A
  regression test that has only ever been seen passing is not known to test anything.

## Examples

**Correct** (proper naming + Arrange/Act/Assert) — Unreal:

```cpp
#include "Misc/AutomationTest.h"

#if WITH_DEV_AUTOMATION_TESTS

IMPLEMENT_SIMPLE_AUTOMATION_TEST(FHealthTakeDamageTest, "<Project>.Health.TakeDamageReducesHealth",
    EAutomationTestFlags::EditorContext | EAutomationTestFlags::ProductFilter)

bool FHealthTakeDamageTest::RunTest(const FString& Parameters)
{
    // Arrange
    FHealthPool Health(100);

    // Act
    Health.TakeDamage(25);

    // Assert
    TestEqual(TEXT("health after 25 damage"), Health.GetCurrent(), 75);
    return true;
}

#endif
```

**Incorrect**:

```cpp
IMPLEMENT_SIMPLE_AUTOMATION_TEST(FTest1, "<Project>.Test1",  // VIOLATION: no descriptive name
    EAutomationTestFlags::EditorContext | EAutomationTestFlags::ProductFilter)
bool FTest1::RunTest(const FString& Parameters)
{
    FHealthPool H(100);
    H.TakeDamage(25);  // VIOLATION: no arrange step, no clear assert
    TestTrue(TEXT("hurt"), H.GetCurrent() < 100);  // VIOLATION: imprecise assertion
    return true;
}
```
