# Test Standards

- Test naming follows the engine's language — every name says the scenario and
  the expected result:
  - **Unity (NUnit, Unity Test Framework):** class `[System]Tests` in a file of
    the same name, method `[Scenario]_[Expected]` in PascalCase; EditMode tests
    under `HarvestPanic/Assets/Tests/EditMode/`, PlayMode under
    `HarvestPanic/Assets/Tests/PlayMode/`, each with its own `.asmdef`
- Every test must have a clear arrange/act/assert structure
- Unit tests must not depend on external state (filesystem, network, database)
- Integration tests must clean up after themselves
- Performance tests must specify acceptable thresholds and fail if exceeded
- Test data must be defined in the test or in dedicated fixtures, never shared mutable state
- Mock external dependencies — tests should be fast and deterministic
- Every bug fix must have a regression test that would have caught the original bug —
  and **you must watch it fail before you trust it.** Run the new test against the
  unfixed code, confirm it fails, then apply the fix and confirm it passes. A
  regression test that has only ever been seen passing is not known to test anything.

  > This is `.claude/rules/skill-authoring.md`'s "a gate you have not watched fail
  > is not a gate", applied to tests. It is written out here because stating the
  > *goal* is not enough. A regression test for an iteration-order defect can use
  > a fixture where no cell takes part in two transfers per tick — it then passes
  > against the very bug it was written for, and looks authoritative doing it. The
  > fixture, not the assertion, is what makes it useless, and only running it
  > against the unfixed code exposes that.

## Examples

**Correct** (proper naming + Arrange/Act/Assert) — Unity, NUnit (`HarvestPanic/Assets/Tests/EditMode/HealthTests.cs`):

```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;

public class HealthTests
{
    [Test]
    public void TakeDamage_ReducesHealth()
    {
        // Arrange
        var health = new Health(maxHealth: 100);

        // Act
        health.TakeDamage(25);

        // Assert
        Assert.AreEqual(75, health.Current);
    }
}
```

**Incorrect**:

```csharp
[Test]
public void Test1()  // VIOLATION: no descriptive name
{
    var h = new Health(100);
    h.TakeDamage(25);              // VIOLATION: no arrange step, no clear assert
    Assert.IsTrue(h.Current < 100); // VIOLATION: imprecise assertion
}
```
